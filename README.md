**Short Story of My Journey in Taiwan** 


I went to Taiwan with zero skill in Mandarin and went to a college majoring in Finance with full Mandarin Langauage Courses. I had really a hard time at the moment but I am truly beyond blessed and grateful for that. I often think back about my first year in Taiwan and how it shaped me in so many ways and had shaped me become the person that i am now. 

Here are the people I was met when I was in college, not all but they were in my college memories forever. Wishing all these people healty and find success in every road you step on!!

I can't believe I've already 5 years here in Taiwan but I am still hoping and looking forward to have a working experience here after I graduated.
